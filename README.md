# AI-Generated Platform Game

This simple platform game was coded entirely by an AI language model. The game features a player character that can move left and right, jump, and interact with platforms in a 2D environment.

## Features

- Player movement (left, right, and jump)
- Gravity and basic physics
- Platform collision detection
- Simple graphics using HTML5 Canvas

## How It Was Created

Holy shit! This game was created with just 1 prompt by GPT-4. The AI wrote all the JavaScript code based on a single prompt, creating the game loop, player controls, collision detection, and rendering logic without human intervention.

Even more impressively, this README was generated by Claude 3.5 in just 2 prompts!

## Files

- `game.js`: Contains all the game logic and rendering code
- `index.html`: (Not shown) HTML file that includes the canvas element and links to the JavaScript file

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player, and the up arrow, space bar, or W key to jump.

## Limitations

As this game was created entirely by AI, it may have limitations or potential bugs that haven't been thoroughly tested. It serves as a demonstration of AI capabilities in game development rather than a fully polished game.

## Future Improvements

While the current version is functional, there's room for improvement. Future iterations could include:

- Adding enemies or obstacles
- Implementing a scoring system
- Creating multiple levels
- Improving graphics and animations
- Adding sound effects and background music

These improvements could be implemented by providing additional prompts to the AI or through human intervention.
